## What is big data?

- In layman's language "data that cannot be processed or stored on a single computing system".
- More formal definition given by IBM is governed by 3V's / 5V's.
	- **Volume**: Data that is huge cannot be stored in one machine.
	- **Variety**: Data with variety of format, can be structured, unstructured or semi-structured.
	- **Velocity**: Speed at which data is inserted and consumed.
	- **Veracity**: The quality or correctness of the data.
	- **Value**: Should able to generate value out of the data.

## Monolithic Vs Distributed system

- **Monolithic** :- One big system that holds a lot of resources and thereby high computation power. Performance does not increase in same ratio as the resource.
- Distributed system:- Is a cluster of system grouped together with each other holding its own resources. To scale up you need to increase node.

## Hadoop overview

### What is Hadoop?

- It is framework to solve big data problems. 
- It is combination of tools and technologies to solve big data problem.
- There are 3 core components
	1. **HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)**: It take care of storage
	2. **MapReduce**: Distributed processing 
	3. **YARN(Yet Another Resource Negotiator)**: Resource manager
- Writing a map reduce is really hard.-Java it is obsolete.
- Hadoop has three major version
	- Hadoop 1 - 2007 
	- Hadoop 2 - 2012
	- Hadoop 3 - Current version

### Hadoop eco-system

- **Sqoop**:- Migrate data from dB to HDFS and vise a versa.
- **Pig**:- It is a scripting language It helps in clean and process the data it is outdated language.
- **Hive**:- Provides a SQL interface to query a data.
- **Oozie**:- A workflow scheduler.
- **HBase**:- is a NoSQL database.

### Challenges with Hadoop

- Map reduce is very slow and its really hard to write the MapReduce code.
- We need to write learn so many different components and each has its own big learning curve.
- It is mostly used for on-premises system.

### Internals of HDFS
- HDFS follows a master (name node), slave (data node) architecture
![[HDFS_internals.svg]]

#### Name node: 
- It holds the meta data. i. e. it stores the where the sub files are stored in each data node
#### Data node:
- Node where actual data is stored 
- Current version of HDFS has 128 MB as block size
- Whenever a client wants a file it goes to name node
- Redundancy of data is kept in multiple nodes which is governed by replication factor Currently replication factor is 3 by default mean the data is replicated in 3 nodes is kept.
- Every Data node sends a live signal or heartbeat to name node every specific interval.
- When ever the a name node fails secondary name node takes its place.
## Cloud and it's advantages

- 3 types of cloud services
	 - **Public cloud** - [AWS, Azure, GCP] 
	 - **Private cloud** - with in the organization 
	 - **Hybrid cloud** - Public + Private
### Advantages
- Scalable
- No requirement of Capital Expense only require Operational Expense
- Agile
- Geo-distribution
- Disaster recovery
- Cost effective.

## What is Apache Spark?

- Mapreduce is biggest bottle neck.
- Apache spark is general purpose, in-memory, compute engine
- Sparks replaces Mapreduce
- Spark needs storage and a resource manage.
	- **Storage** - HDFS, S3, ADLS Gen2, GCS, local storage 
	- **Resoure manager** - YARN, Mesos, Kubernetes
- Its a plug & play compute engine.
- Spark code can be written in scala, python, java and R.
- Spark itself is written in scala.

## Database Vs Data warehouse Vs Datalake

### Database
- Transactional data
- Online transactional processing.
- Structural data
- Recent data
- Schema on write
- **Example**: Oracle, MySQL

### Data warehouse
- Analytical processing where historical data is required to find insight.
- In database, complex queries can reduce the speed of transactional process.
- We can migrate the data from database to data warehouse to do analytics.
- Structured data - Schema on write.
- Storage cost is high but less than database.
- it follows Extract, Transform & Load process.
- **Example**: Teradata

### Datalake
- To get insights from huge amount of data
- The data is present in raw format.
- It can be structure or unstructured format.
- It follows ELT process
- Cost effective
- Schema on read.

## Data engineering flow

### On-premises

### Azure Cloud

### AWS Cloud

## Serverless v/s server based services

### Serverless
- **Example**: AWS Athena
- Will charge you  based on of data scanned.
- You will use resources from a shared pool will be less expensive.
- Since resources are not dedicated there-will be impact on performance

### Server based
- **Example**: Aws Redshift
- Need to turn on a dedicated cluster it will charge from the time it is turned on till it was switched off.



## Concept of Data 
- Process the data where it is present Hadoop works on the principle of data locality.
